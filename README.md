# Insurance Cost Prediction ML Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict insurance costs based on various factors using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset containing information such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, the model is trained to accurately estimate the medical charges a person might incur. This project walks through the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a hands-on example of machine learning in action.

## Features

**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features through encoding and scaling.

**Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant variables that impact the insurance costs.

**Machine Learning Models**: Several regression algorithms are applied, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression

**Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of different models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

**Data Visualization**: Visualizing relationships between features and insurance costs using plots for better insights.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-cost-prediction.git
    cd insurance-cost-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Insurance_Cost_Prediction_ML_Model.ipynb
    ```
# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

**Age**: Age of the individual

**BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight

**Children**: Number of children/dependents

**Smoker**: Whether the individual smokes or not

**Region**: The geographical region of the individual

**Charges**: Medical charges incurred (target variable)

The dataset is available from various open sources or can be created manually based on similar attributes.

# Results

After training and testing different machine learning models, the performance is evaluated using common regression metrics. The results are visualized to better understand which features contribute most to the predicted insurance cost and how well the model fits the data.
